            <h2>What is Social Emotional Learning?</h2>
            <p>Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) is the process of developing the skills that help us understand ourselves, build healthy relationships, manage challenges, and make thoughtful decisions. SEL supports both academic success and personal well-being by helping students recognize emotions, communicate effectively, handle stress, and work with others. The most widely used framework for SEL comes from CASEL (the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning), a leading organization that researches and defines what effective SEL looks like in schools. CASEL identifies five core areas of social and emotional development, which are shown in the visual on this page.</p>
            
            <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
            <p>SEL is important because it strengthens the skills students need to succeed both in and out of school. Research shows that when students learn strategies for managing emotions, building relationships, and making responsible decisions, they are better prepared to learn, collaborate, and cope with challenges.</p>
            
            <h3>Effective SEL helps:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>create positive, supportive classroom environments</li>
                <li>improve communication, empathy, and conflict-resolution skills</li>
                <li>boost focus, motivation, and academic performance</li>
                <li>support mental health and overall well-being</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How This Website Supports SEL</h2>
            <p>This website is designed to help students and educators explore SEL in practical, engaging ways. Each lesson or activity is aligned with one of the five CASEL competencies, offering concrete strategies, hands-on exercises, and reflection opportunities. Students can explore topics in communication, empathy, relationships, decision-making, and emotional regulation, while educators can access tools to guide instruction and facilitate growth.</p>
