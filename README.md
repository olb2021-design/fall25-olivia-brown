Formatting: Option A: Multi-Page Website 
This just made the most sense to my brain
My pages: Home (index), About, Activities, Community
Horizontal navigation bar with buttons for each of the pages
The challenge I forsee is using the shared css file and wanting to format very specific items in certain pages.
