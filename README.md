Formatting: Option A: Multi-Page Website 
This just made the most sense to my brain
My pages: Home (index), About, Activities, Community
Horizontal navigation bar with buttons for each of the pages
The challenge I forsee is using the shared css file and wanting to format very specific items in certain pages.

Things I did this week: 
1. Added Java script for the activities page to replace html (loops through an array to perform the function of creating elements: Lesson Title, Lesson Description, Lesson Image, and Lesson Link)
2. Updated the navigation bar 
3. Uploaded stock photos to replace the random photos 

Next Steps 
1. Java code for community page 
2. Cleaning up grid on the home page!!! 
3. Adding interactive details to the About page 
4. Create new page for extended Lesson details on activity page

Notes
1. Used ChatGPT for troubleshooting and line-by-line explanation after adjusting code from class and Brightspace
2. Found that the console was helpful for troubleshooting on my own
